## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22.x)

  We currently depend on Node 22+ for local development as we use new test APIs such as [snapshot testing](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html#snapshot-testing)! At some point we might move to a different test runner, but this works great to move fast in early alpha days.

### Setup

Use a codespace and you are all set: https://github.com/copilot-extensions/preview-sdk.js/codespaces.

Or, if you prefer to develop locally:

```
gh repo clone copilot-extensions/preview-sdk.js
cd preview-sdk.js
npm install
```

### Running tests

```
npm test
```

As part of the tests, we test types for our public APIs (`npm run test:types`) and our code (`npm run test:tsc`). Run `npm run` to see all available scripts.
